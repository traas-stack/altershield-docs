## Question Guidelines

If you encounter difficulties while reading AlterShield-related documents, blogs, or source code, the community welcomes all students to submit feedback through the Github Issue section. You can write your questions, deidentified change failure cases, or any doubts about AlterShield in the issue. Submitting an issue can help future users, who can find solutions by searching through search engines when they encounter similar issues.

If there is a delay in the response to the issue, you can contact the group administrator in the DingTalk group, who will help to urge the project maintainer to reply to the issue.



## Participating in Open Source Co-building
As an open source community, we welcome various forms of contributions. You can participate in community building in forms including but not limited to:

+ Correcting typos: Help us point out errors in the documents.
+ Discussion of issues and cases: Your company's change failure cases, de-identified, can be discussed to find solutions together.
+ Bug reporting: Help us identify logical errors in AlterShield.
+ Discussion of new feature scenarios: Any change-related functions that AlterShield does not yet have can be discussed together.
+ Improving the OCMS protocol: Currently, the OCMS open source is still in version 0.1. If there are situations in your scenario that cannot be adapted, you can directly participate in discussions and extensions.
+ Improving the Operator ecosystem: Currently, the Operator will be docked with Kubernetes Deployment in version 0.1. You can transform and dock the Operator under your CI/CD tool to extend its ecosystem.
+ Integrating more monitoring tools: You can integrate the monitoring tools you use into the observable defense capability provided by AlterShield to expand the range of detection capabilities.
+ Consolidate your change defense expert experience: You can use Plugin or SPI extensions to consolidate your change defense expert experience into AlterShield.

#### Reviewer （Optional）

Module owners are responsible for issue review and code review for a specific module.
